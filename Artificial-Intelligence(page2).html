    <h1>HOW IS AI USED?</h1>
      <p>Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Narrow AI:Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. </li>
        <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem. </li>
      </ul>
